# YouTubeToRedditBot

This is a simple personal use script that posts my latests YouTube video to any number of subreddits of my choosing. (I run a small YouTube  chiptune music channel with 50K subscribers; it's one of my main sources of side income. Check it out if you are so inclined: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsej4tgCoXDgVH3J7M3NMgw)

## Getting Started

As this uses my Google API and Reddit API keys, it wouldn't make sense for this to be deployed online at this point in time.

## Built With

* Python
* JSON

## Acknowledgments

* StackOverflow

## Possible improvements to be made

* Write a productionized version that utilizes the user's own API keys
